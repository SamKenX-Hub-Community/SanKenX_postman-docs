## What is SSO?

Single sign-on (SSO) services enable you to manage your team’s identity across all the SaaS products that you use.

SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

An example of SSO is Google's sign-in implementation for products like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Drive. Any user that is signed in to one of Google's products is automatically signed in to their other products as well.

### What are the advantages of SSO?

* Removes the need for users to remember and manage multiple passwords.
* Simplifies users' experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.
* Increases productivity by significantly reducing the password-related support emails.
* Reduces phishing and thereby making sure users aren't tricked into giving away sensitive information.

### Prerequisites for SSO with Postman

* Team’s identity provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard.

### Supported IdPs

Professional plans:

* [Google Workspace](/docs/administration/sso/google-workspace/)

> Professional plans purchased prior to September 14, 2022 can also use SSO with Okta, OneLogin, Duo, Ping Identity, Microsoft AD FS, Azure AD, and custom SAML.

Enterprise plans:

* [Google Workspace](/docs/administration/sso/google-workspace/)
* [Okta](/docs/administration/sso/okta/)
* [OneLogin](/docs/administration/sso/onelogin/)
* [Duo](/docs/administration/sso/duo/)
* [Ping Identity](/docs/administration/sso/ping-identity/)
* [Microsoft AD FS](/docs/administration/sso/microsoft-adfs/)
* [Azure AD](/docs/administration/sso/azure-ad/)
* [Custom SAML](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/)

### SSO setup for SAML 2.0 compliant IdPs

Most SAML 2.0 compliant identity providers require the same information about the service provider for setup (Postman is the service provider). These values are specific to a Postman team and are available after configuring SSO in the Edit Team Page.

Learn more about [setting up SSO](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/).

**Note** - While configuring your IdP, make sure the user’s email address is set in attribute statements.

**Note** - Postman’s form-based authentication mechanism and Google OAuth 2.0 remain enabled even if SSO is configured for a team.
