_Postman Flows_ is a visual tool to build API-driven applications – a tool to build software for the API-First world. You can use flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.

## What is Postman Flows?

Flows is an API-centric visual application development interface. It provides you with an infinite canvas to arrange and connect APIs.

It's powered by the Postman Public API Network and your Collections. Flows provides data manipulation capabilities to bridge the gap between your APIs, and data visualization to show the final output of your flows.

You can also deploy your flows and run them in the cloud. WebHooks enable you to integrate with other applications.

## What can you do with flows?

Flows are the ultimate way to easily take data from an API-enabled product, manipulate it to meet your needs, and see the results. Or you could
take data from one API-enabled product, make decisions or process the data, then send it to another API-enabled product. This means you can build real-time integrations between two API-enabled products.

Check out our Flows Workspaces filled with examples:

* [Business Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/business-flows)
* [Integration Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/integration-flows)
* [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/natural-language-processing-nlp-flows)
* [Slack Integration Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/slack-integration-flows)
* [DevOps Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/devops-flows)
* [Utility Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/utility-flows)
* [Miscellaneous Flows](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/miscellaneous-flows)

These workspaces contains example flows utilizing a multitude of APIs for different products and tools, plus all the related collections and environments needed. You can fork the flows to your own workspace, try them out, and then make your own changes and customizations.

> Postman Flows is free to use for up to three users in our Free plan. Postman Flows is available as an add-on on our [Professional plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing/).
